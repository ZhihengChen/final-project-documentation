                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>I wanted to create an app that could visualise the soil nutrients in a given location, based on existing open-source data. The idea is to give perspective to the gold that lies beneath our feet and to raise awareness of good soil health.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                <p>I was fascinated by artists who use data in their art and represent it in abstract ways. The work “Your Brain on Music” By Laurie Frick, was a big inspiration in terms of visual representation and the use of data that is hugely personal. Artists outside of data that influenced my visual language include Maxim Zhestkov - especially his particle systems in 'Elements' and 'Volumes', Rachel Whiteread's use of see-through, coloured repeated blocks of resin in 'Untitled (One Hundred Spaces)' and the scattered, floating material quality of Cornelia Parker's  'Exploding Shed'.
                    <br><br>
                Most of the artworks mentioned are in physical, installation form, which is what I intend for my piece to be in the future, however I was also very drawn to the idea of having an app version, with which I could visualize the particles in advance in order to give me an idea of the way it would look, as well as the possible scope for physicalizing.
                <br><br>
                The initial idea started off as a sketch, with the idea that one could move around and inside the particles and click on them to learn more about their importance. Since I had already done a data visualization for one of my weekly assignments, I could use some of the knowledge and code within that in my new, 3d project.
                </p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <p>I decided to use three.js for this, as I haven't used other 3D engines before and I already knew that it was possible to process data in Javascript, as well as different ways of doing it. The main problem I encountered early on was the type of file that was available - an ESRI Shapefile - which is a geolocation file made with specific software, such as QGIS. After days of research, I decided to in the first instance, manually write out the data in a .json file before committing to reading multiple files for multiple locations. If I could achieve all the visual aesthetic with one, the my plan was to move on to the 'all'.

                    <br><br>
                However even just using data for one location took a really long time to get right in three,js, as it's not a library I have spent much time with before (apart from our weekly 3d assignment). 
                
                

                <br><br>
                I started with getting some spheres up, and attaching different data to them.</p>

                <img class="page-img-s" src="../assets/images/tv.jpeg">
                <p>After this, it was important to get the materials right, including reflections and surrounding environment. I used an HDR image so the material would look more 'shiny', but if this was an AR experience it would have to use reflections of the real environment.
                    <br><br>
                The time-lapse of the slider is now very smooth, however it was hugely problematic to get it to work, due to other work arounds like sphere positions and difficulties with mouse intersections. 
                </p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>In the near future I want to make this app into an XR experience, one which could be used by anyone to view their recorded location's soil nutrients and I would also like to add a location selector for displaying particles from different places. To add the locations I will need to figure out how to read Shapefiles in Javascript, but I have already found useful tutorials online with useful tips, so I know that it has been done before.

                <br><br>
                I also think there is a certain limitation when representing data in such a scientific way, and so for my physical piece I would want to explore a more philosophical side to the project.
